					<p class="bio">
						Will Saunders is a web developer with seven years experience designing responsive, interactive web experiences for world famous brands like Disney,
						Honda, and Nickelodeon to name at least three. Born in sunny Florida, Will moved to sunny Los Angeles right after graduating the University of Central
						Florida's Web Development program in 2013 and has been loving it ever since. He got his start developing terrible websites for his friends' bands. You
						could say he played the "keyboard"...but that would just confuse people. He's come a long way since then, but still has a long way to go before he achieves
						the title of Ultimate Developer. When Will isn't developing websites, he's annoying his golden retriever 'Ser Davos', performing comedic improv with his
						group 'Direct To Video', or seeing a movie. And just for the record, Will doesn't normally refer to himself in the third person.
