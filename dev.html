				<p>Welcome intrepid explorer! This planet is home to Will Saunders, the Front End Developer. Originally from Florida, I've been developing for the web for five years and have worked on projects for national brands such as Honda, Intuit, Netflix, Fox, Paramount, Nickelodeon, and General Mills. Primarily, I work with HTML/CSS/JS, but I've also done work as a full stack developer with PHP.</p>
