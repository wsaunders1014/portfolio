			<h3>About Me</h3>
				<p>     Originally from the post apocalyptic wasteland that is Florida, Will Saunders somehow made it out without biting anyone's face off. Though primarily interested in brooding, thought provoking sci-fi thrillers, his love of watching cinema can't be restrained to one genre. His first two scripts have garnered much praise from several contests and industry readers. When he's not writing, Will can be usually found doing improv comedy through Upright Citizen's Brigade or playing video games. </p>
