Born in sunny Florida, Will moved to sunny Los Angeles right after graduating the University of Central Florida's Web Development program in 2013 and has been loving it ever since. He got his start developing terrible websites for his friends' bands. You could say he played the "keyboard"...but that would just confuse people. He's come a long way since then, but still has a long way to go before he achieves the title of Ultimate Developer. When Will isn't developing websites, he's annoying his golden retriever 'Ser Davos', performing comedic improv with his group 'Direct To Video', or seeing a movie. And just for the record, Will doesn't normally refer to himself in the third person. </p> </section> <div class=question> Oh... What are his skills?
